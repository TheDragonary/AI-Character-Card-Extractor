# AI Character Card Extractor
Extracts metadata from AI Character Cards in PNG format

## How to Use

Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/TheDragonary/AI-Character-Card-Extractor.git
```

Then, put your character cards in the same folder, open up a terminal and run ``node index.js character.png``

You could also just insert the whole file path instead, like this:
```
node index.js "C:\Users\[name]\Pictures\character.png"
```
